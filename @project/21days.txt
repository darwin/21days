★★★ Form better habits in 21 days ★★★

Millions of people want to improve their lives a bit. They want to start exercising, quit smoking, lose weight, learn Spanish, learn to play piano... you name it. They try... and fail. 21days is a web/mobile application which helps them to set up, form and stick to desirable daily routines.

★ Problem
People are trying and failing with their resolutions and dreams about better themselves.

★ Solution
Web/mobile application which helps them to set up, form and stick to daily routines by motivating them "carrot and stick" way. It is not about goals and tasks - it is about routines. Not about dreams but life change.

Interesting fact: Did you know it takes about 21 days for people to get use to new routine? This is why the first 21 days are extremely hard.

★ Magic
There are three features creating winning formula of 21 days:
1) Focus on daily habits tracking and personal satisfaction comming from successfuly filled in form.
2) Peer pressure. Your friends become your "angels" nad supervise you. If you start to fail, application alerts them first to help you get back on track
3) Fun. We use game principles. You get praise and badges for successfully completed resolutions. 

You can see mockups here: https://gomockingbird.com/mockingbird/#l8eb1c3

★ Business model
The service is free for users. There are two main sources of revenue:

➀ PREMIUM accounts for trainers, coaches, therapists, teachers etc...) For as little as 16 USD/month and close to zero effort they will get a tool to "coach" their learners throught a week. They can set up routines for them, commenting privately, see statistics etc... It is up to them how much they want to be involved personally and how much they leave automated. This service is added value and differenciator for theirs business.
➁ "APPSTORE" for courses. Autors and publishers of courses from any field (fitness, nutrition, self-help, education...) can create (or convert) courses and sell them through our platform to highly motivated customers. There is a huge opportunity to consolidate currently fragmented market and to create completely new one by lowering entrance barriers for courses authors (think www.etsy.com or iphone appstore).

Premium accounts is low hanging fruit, "appstore" for courses is a main opportunity field.

★ Competition
We don't hide there are couple of similar services solving part of the problem. None of them can match our winning formula and pricing scheme. Please see attached comparsion table.

★ Marketing
Core target group: middle-aged affluent US females with Facebook account

From marketers perspective two points are worth mentioning:
a) we have virality built in the application ("angels" and learners)
b) we have an evocative story about 21 days habit forming theory

It is important to remember that “discipline” derives from the Latin “disciplina,” meaning teaching or learning. Desire and drive alone do not add up to discipline. It must be learned.

Telling yourself to “try harder” is not enough. Telling yourself you could get the information for free “if you really wanted” is delusional. Trusted guidance matters.

21 days

Hi. I'm Tomas and this is my startup idea "21 days"
21 days is an app for loosers.
Yes. App for loosers. For every one of us who ever tried to quit smoking, start exercising regulary (hands up!), meditating, learning new language... you name it. Who tried and fail.
21 days is here to save your selfrespect. It is a service which helps you to set up goals and routines leading towards these goals and stick with them.
How is it different from similar services?
Two features are cruical:
1) it heavily uses power of social web to motivate you and protect from failure
2) and it uses your mobile device to track your progress and "supervise" you
There is much more I can fit into 90 sec. So please take your smartphones and go to bit.ly/ipo48 (yes, i've steal the keyword for my project). I'm not hiding anything form you so you will find all details including business model.
If you are like the idea, especiall if you are developer, please join me.
Because I'm very good with ideas - I'm working as strategy direrctor in the biggest advertising agency in town but I'm very poor coder.
Thank you very much.

And interesting fact: 21 days is a minimum to set up a routine.


21days
Teaser
Millions of people want to improve their lives. They want to exercise more, learn languages, play piano, quit smoking, eat healthier, learn Python, you name it. They try... and they fail. 21days is a web/mobile application which helps them to stick with their resolutions by using power of social web and daily mobile journal interaction.

Pitch
★ Project details
21days is a web application which basically allows users to:
1) Set up a goal (e.g. "Learn Spanish")
2) Set up one or more tasks to reach the goal (e.g. "Learn at least 5 days a week at least for 20 minutes")
3) Find one or more "angels" (supporters) who will be informed about successes and failures, who can comment, motivate and help (friends, family, teachers, strangers...)
4) Start their 21 days routine (why 21 days? see below)
5) Fill in journal about successes or failures (daily or in other set interval)
Essential parts of the project:
- mobile journaling application with push feature putting pressure to the user
- Facebook and Twitter integration for connecting with "angels" and public pledges
Other features: Discussions and online support groups. Badges and other game theory based tools to make everything more entertaining.

★ Brief competitor analysis
There are couple of similar services solving part of the problem:
http://www.43things.com (very good at goal setting)
http://www.joesgoals.com (very good at journaling)
http://www.goalmigo.com (good in use of supporters)
Recently I have found http://www.stickk.com. The bad news: it is very close to 21days idea. The good news: it lacks mobile app and is overall badly designed (check for yourself).

★ Business model
The app itself will be free for regular users. There will be two main sources of revenue:
1) PRO users (teachers, sport coaches, therapists etc...) which will get the advanced version of the service with an option to set up goals and tasks for others, private comments, statistics etc...
2) Service "appstore" where publishers of correspondence courses can sell their services to highly motivated users.
The biggest potential is in US education system (US school districts multilicenses) and courses appstore.

★ Marketing tools
Except standard marketing tools there is high virallity built into the service - public pledges on FB or Twitter, finding "angels" among non-users, iPhone app in appstore.

★ Notes
Original inspiration for this project was "Modrý život" (Blue Life) routine invented by Czech writer Jaroslav Foglar for Boy Scouts (see attachment).
21 days is a minimum to form a routine. Users can for sure continue with the service or set up another goal/task.
