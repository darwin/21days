			<p class="bold">Hello</p>

			<p>The 21 Days is weak’s will remedy. It is web and mobile application which will help you to set up new daily routines and stick with them at least for 21 days to form desired behavioural change (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/captology/3-steps-to-new-habits">Read more</a>).
			</p>

			<p>This project was born in Prague at <a href="http://ipo48.org/startup/21days">IPO48</a> as a 48-hour experiment. We have decided not to leave it behind because many people are telling us they would like to use it for themselves.</p>

			<p>To make a brilliant product from it we need your help! We are looking for: <br />
			★ Artist / Designer<br />
			★ Javascript Developer (node.js, backbone.js)<br />
			</p>

			<p>
			Even if you have just some spare to help us with logo or a few lines of code or just testing or just want to say “Hi”, <a href="mailto:tomas@21dayshabit.com"> drop us a note</a>.
